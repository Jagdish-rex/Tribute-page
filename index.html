                <h2>Little Dragon Li</h2>
                <p><b>Bruce Lee</b> was a legendary martial artist and actor who is widely regarded as one of the most
                    influential figures in the history of martial arts. He is known for his incredible physical prowess
                    and his philosophical approach to martial arts. Lee's films, including "Enter the Dragon" and "Way
                    of the Dragon," paved the way for the modern martial arts movie genre. He died at the age of 32.</p>

                <P>Hollywood took notice and soon Bruce was making
                    the first Hollywood / Hong Kong coproduction with a film called Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately,
                    Bruce Lee died in 1973 before this film was released. Today Bruce Lee’s legacy of self expression,
                    equality, and pioneering innovation continues
                    to inspire people all around the world.</p>
